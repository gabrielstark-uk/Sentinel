## Project Architecture

### Current Stack (Being Migrated)
- **Frontend**: TypeScript + React + Vite
- **Backend**: Node.js + Express + TypeScript
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- **WebSocket**: Real-time threat updates

### Target Stack (In Progress)
- **Backend Core**: 
  - Julia: Advanced signal processing, ML algorithms, electromagnetic analysis
  - ADA: System control, safety-critical operations, hardware interfaces
- **Frontend**:
  - Rust (WebAssembly): High-performance UI components, real-time rendering
  - R: Statistical analysis, data visualization, threat modeling
- **Integration**: WebSocket + REST APIs between components
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (no change)

### Key Components
1. **Threat Detection Engine** (Julia)
   - Frequency analysis and ML classification
   - ADS detection and countermeasures
   - Real-time signal processing

2. **Sonic Disruptor System** (Julia + Python)
   - Advanced sonic countermeasure deployment
   - Frequency analysis and optimal disruption calculation
   - Multi-platform integration with TypeScript frontend
   - Real-time threat neutralization capabilities

3. **System Control Layer** (ADA)
   - Hardware interface management
   - Safety-critical operations
   - Authentication and security

4. **Analysis Dashboard** (Rust + R)
   - Real-time threat visualization
   - Statistical analysis of patterns
   - High-performance user interface

5. **Data Processing** (R)
   - Statistical modeling
   - Threat pattern analysis
   - Reporting and visualization

## Migration Strategy
1. Maintain existing TypeScript/React frontend temporarily
2. Implement Julia signal processing modules
